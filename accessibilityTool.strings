    <value>The AcceleratorKey property is a string containing the accelerator key combinations for the automation element.  Accelerator key (also called shortcut key) combinations invoke an action.

    <value>The AutomationId property is a string containing the UI Automation identifier (ID) for the automation element. When it is available, the AutomationId of an element must be the same in any instance of the application, regardless of the local language. The value should be unique among sibling elements, but not necessarily unique across the entire desktop. For example, multiple instances of an application, or multiple folder views in Microsoft Windows Explorer, may contain elements with the same AutomationId property, such as "SystemMenuBar". While support for AutomationId is always recommended for better testability, this property is not mandatory. Where it is supported, AutomationId is useful for creating a test automation script that runs regardless of the UI language. Clients should make no assumptions regarding the AutomationIds exposed by other applications. AutomationId is not guaranteed to be stable across different releases or builds of an application.

If the element has a clickable point that can cause it to receive the focus, the element is considered to be on-screen while a portion of the element is off screen. The value of the property is not affected by occlusion by other windows, or by whether the element is visible on a specific monitor. If the IsOffscreen property is TRUE, the UI element is scrolled off-screen or collapsed. The element is temporarily hidden, yet it remains in the end-user's perception and continues to be included in the UI model. The object can be brought back into view by scrolling, clicking a drop-down, and so on. Objects that the end-user does not perceive at all, or that are "programmatically hidden" (for example, a dialog box that has been dismissed, but the underlining object is still cached by the application) should not be in the automation element tree in the first place (instead of setting the state of IsOffscreen to TRUE).

  <string id="8209" name="a11y_Name_tooltip">
    <value>Name is a string for the text representation of the automation element. The Name property should always be the same as the label text on screen. For example, Name must be "Browse" for the button element with the label "Browse". The Name property must not include the mnemonic character for the access keys (that is, "&amp;"), which is underlined in the UI text presentation. Also, the Name property should not be an extended or modified version of the on-screen label because the inconsistency between the name and the label can cause confusion among client applications and users. When the corresponding label text is not visible on screen, or when it is replaced by graphics, alternative text should be chosen. The alternative text should be concise, intuitive, and localized to the application UI language, or to the operating system default UI language. The alternative text should not be a detailed description of the visual details, but a concise description of the UI function or feature as if it were labeled by simple text. For example, the Windows Start menu button is named "Start" (button) instead of "Windows Logo on blue round sphere graphics" (button). For more information, see Creating Text Equivalents for Images. When a UI label uses text graphics (for example, using "&gt;&gt;" for a button that adds an item from right to left), the Name property should be overridden by an appropriate text alternative (for example, "Add"). However the practice of using text graphics as a UI label is discouraged due to both localization and accessibility concerns. The Name property must not include the control role or type information, such as "button" or "list"; otherwise, it will conflict with the text from the LocalizedControlType property. The Name property may not be used as a unique identifier among siblings. However, as long as it is consistent with the UI presentation, the same Name value can be supported among peers. For test automation, the clients should consider using the AutomationId or RuntimeId property. The Name property has a variant type of VT_BSTR; the default value is an empty string.</value>
